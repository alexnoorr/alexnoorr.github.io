            <p>I am a Junior Data Scientist at InsightIn Health, where I work on transforming healthcare data into predictive insights that help improve patient outcomes and support strategic decision-making. I am currently base in Boston, MA working fully remote out of Baltimore, MD. With experience in HIPAA-compliant data pipelines, machine learning model development, and cross-functional collaboration, I enjoy solving meaningful problems at the intersection of data and healthcare.
            I earned my B.S. in Data Science from Boston University, where I also served in multiple leadership roles in Kappa Delta Sorority, including Vice President. I am passionate about using data to make healthcare more proactive, personalized, and effective â€” and motivated by opportunities to collaborate, innovate, and create real-world impact.</p>
