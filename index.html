            <p>I am a Junior Data Scientist with experience turning complex data into actionable insights that support strategic decision-making and measurable impact. I am currently based in Boston, MA and work fully remote. With experience developing data pipelines, building predictive models, and collaborating across cross-functional teams, I enjoy solving meaningful problems through data and analytical thinking.
            I earned my B.S. in Data Science from Boston University, where I also served in multiple leadership roles in Kappa Delta Sorority, including Vice President. I am passionate about applying data to drive innovation, improve processes, and support informed decisions â€” and motivated by opportunities to collaborate, learn, and create real-world results.</p>
