        <h1>Work Experience</h1>
        <p>I have worked as a Data Science Intern at InsightIn Health in Baltimore, MD for two summers, 2023 and 2024. In May 2025, I was offered a role as Junior Data Scientist with the company and have been in this role ever since.</p>
        </p>I am a Data Scientist with hands-on experience working in the healthcare technology space at InsightIn Health. I specialize in transforming complex healthcare datasets into actionable insights and building predictive machine learning models that support patient-focused solutions. My work includes maintaining HIPAA-compliant data workflows, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and developing data-driven strategies to improve healthcare outcomes and business decision-making. I bring strong technical skills in Python, Pandas, and NumPy, along with a passion for using data to drive meaningful impact in healthcare.</p>
