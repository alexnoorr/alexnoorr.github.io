            <p>Over the summers of 2023 and 2024, I served as a Data Science Intern at InsightIn Health in Baltimore, MD. In May 2025, I accepted a part-time offer to join the company as a Junior Data Scientist, where I have continued to support data-driven transformation in the healthcare space. I am a Data Scientist with hands-on experience in the healthcare technology industry, specializing in converting complex medical and claims data into actionable insights and predictive analytics.<p> 
            <p>At InsightIn Health, I build and evaluate machine learning models that drive patient-focused outcomes, maintain HIPAA-compliant data workflows, and collaborate with cross-functional teams to support data strategy and product innovation.<p>
            <p>My expertise includes Python, Pandas, NumPy, and scalable model development, with a strong focus on using data to drive informed decisions and meaningful outcomes. I am passionate about applying analytics techniques in thoughtful and impactful ways â€” whether optimizing processes, improving user experiences, or driving strategic insights across industries. I am motivated by opportunities to leverage data responsibly to solve real-world problems, enhance decision-making, and contribute to positive, evidence-based outcomes in diverse environments.<p>
